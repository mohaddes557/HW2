            <p>I am one of CTI's students. I am learning web design. Actually, today I am a beginner, but tomorrow I will be a developer. I really want to become a professional in web design and artificial intelligence. I have studied with different academies, but CTI is very different because it makes students active and engaged. I have already graduated in Educational Psychology in Iran.</p>

            <p>I enjoy reading Psychology books, Listening to English podcasts, Watching online videos about world facts, Teaching, Being a nurse  and Swimming in the pool. These activities calm me down and make me happy. I am here to take a path that brings me closer to my goals and shapes my future the way I want. </p>
